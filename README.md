# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Portfolio
A collection of labs, projects, and security audits completed during the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program. This repository demonstrates my proficiency in Python, SQL, Linux, and SIEM tools.

## Skills & Tools
Languages: Python (Automation), SQL (Data querying)
Operating Systems: Linux (CLI), Windows, macOS
Security Tools: Chronicle (SIEM), Suricata (IDS), Wireshark (Packet Analysis), Tcpdump
Frameworks: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Response)

## Project Highlights
### Governance & Compliance
**Controls and Compliance Checklist**
* **Objective:** Evaluated organizational security posture against industry standards.Conducted a gap analysis to identify missing administrative, technical, and physical controls.

### Incident Response & Analysis
*This section demonstrates my ability to document and analyze security events across the incident lifecycle.*

| Project | Focus Area | Key Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cybersecurity Incident Report** | Detection & Containment | Detailed log of a simulated breach and immediate response steps. |
| **Incident Report Analysis** | Root Cause Analysis | Evaluation of threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). |
| **Security Incident Report** | Post-Incident Reporting | Comprehensive summary for stakeholders including remediation steps. |

### Technical Operations (Linux)
**Managing File Permissions via CLI**
* **Scenario:** Auditing server files to ensure the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
* **Technical Implementation:**
    * Used `ls -l` to identify over-privileged files.
    * Applied `chmod` to restrict read/write/execute permissions.
    * Used `chown` to reassign file ownership to authorized users only.
