## Featured Projects

### Python: Algorithm for File Updates
* **Scenario:** Developed an automation script to manage server access by removing revoked IP addresses from a restricted "allow list" text file.
* **Technical Implementation:** Utilized Python’s `with` statements for secure file I/O, `.split()` and `.join()` for data conversion, and iterative loops to filter unauthorized identifiers.
* **Documentation:** [Algorithm for file updates in Python.pdf](./Course%207:%20Automate%20Cybersecurity%20Tasks%20with%20Python/Algorithm%20for%20file%20updates%20in%20Python.pdf)

### Security Operations: Network Traffic Analysis
* **Scenario:** Investigated a DNS flood and DDoS attack that caused a service outage by analyzing malicious packet signatures.
* **Technical Implementation:** Analyzed network telemetry to identify the attack vector, reconstructed the incident timeline, and documented remediation steps.
* **Documentation:**
  * [Network Traffic Analysis Report](./Course%203%3A%20Connect%20and%20Protect%20-%20Networks%20and%20Network%20Security/Cybersecurity%20Incident%20Report-Network%20Traffic%20Analysis%20MD-Finsihed.pdf)
  * [Incident Report Analysis](./Course%203:%20Connect%20and%20Protect%20-%20Networks%20and%20Network%20Security/Incident%20report%20analysis%20MD%20Finished.pdf)
  * [Security Incident Report](./Course%203:%20Connect%20and%20Protect%20-%20Networks%20and%20Network%20Security/Security%20incident%20report%20MD%20Finished.pdf)

### Governance, Risk, & Compliance: Controls Audit
* **Scenario:** Performed a compliance audit to align organizational security posture with NIST RMF and regulatory standards.
* **Technical Implementation:** Evaluated technical and administrative controls (e.g., encryption, firewall rules) against HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR requirements.
* **Documentation:**
  * [Vulnerability Assessment Report](./Course%205:%20Assets,%20Threats,%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability%20assessment%20report%20MD%20Finished.pdf)
  * [Risk Register Assignment](./Course%205:%20Assets,%20Threats,%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Risk%20register%20Assignment%20MD%20Finished.pdf)
  * [PASTA Worksheet](./Course%205:%20Assets,%20Threats,%20and%20Vulnerabilities/PASTA%20worksheet%20MD%20Finished.pdf)

### Incident Response: Handler’s Journal
* **Scenario:** Documented the identification, triage, and analysis of simulated security events to refine organizational response protocols.
* **Technical Implementation:** Performed file hash analysis and categorized threats using industry-standard frameworks to ensure an accurate audit trail.
* **Documentation:** [Incident Handler's Journal](./Course%206:%20Sound%20the%20Alarm%20-%20Detection%20and%20Response/Incident%20handler's%20journal%20MD%20Finished.pdf)

### Data Security: Access Control & Leak Mitigation
* **Scenario:** Enforced the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and investigated potential data exfiltration points.
* **Technical Implementation:** Mapped user roles to permissions using an Access Control Worksheet and recommended Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls.
* **Documentation:**
  * [Access Control Worksheet](./Course%205:%20Assets,%20Threats,%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Access%20control%20worksheet%20MD%20Finished.pdf)
  * [Data Leak Activity](./Course%205:%20Assets,%20Threats,%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Data%20Leak%20Activity%20MD%20Finished.pdf)

### Linux: File Permissions via CLI
* **Scenario:** Auditing server files to ensure the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
* **Implementation:** Used `ls -l` to identify over-privileged files, `chmod` to restrict permissions, and `chown` to reassign ownership.
* **Documentation:** [File permissions in Linux.pdf](./Course%204:%20Tools%20of%20the%20Trade%20-%20Linux%20and%20SQL/File%20permissions%20in%20Linux%20MD%20Finished.pdf)

### SQL: Security Log Investigation
* **Scenario:** Investigated employee data and logs to identify potential unauthorized access.
* **Implementation:** Utilized `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, and `LIKE` operators with wildcards (%) to filter records and isolate failed login attempts.
* **Documentation:** [Apply filters to SQL queries.pdf](./Course%204:%20Tools%20of%20the%20Trade%20-%20Linux%20and%20SQL/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries%20MD%20Finished.pdf)
