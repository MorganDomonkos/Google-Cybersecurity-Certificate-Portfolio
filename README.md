### Technical Operations (Linux)
**Managing File Permissions via CLI**
* **Scenario:** Auditing server files to ensure the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
* **Technical Implementation:**
    * Used `ls -l` to identify over-privileged files.
    * Applied `chmod` to restrict read/write/execute permissions.
    * Used `chown` to reassign file ownership to authorized users only.
      
### Technical Operations (SQL)
* **Scenario:** Investigated security logs and employee data to identify potential unauthorized access.
   * **Technical Implementation:**
   * Used WHERE and AND filters to isolate failed login attempts occurring after-hours.
   * Utilized OR logic to query specific dates of interest during an investigation.
   * Applied NOT and LIKE operators with wildcards (%) to filter records.
